Inventory App
===================================
The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory.


Key concepts

Some of the key concepts implemented in the inventory app are:
-   Storing information in a SQLite database
-   Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
-   Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
-   Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
-   Updating information based on user input
-   Creating intents to other apps using stored information
